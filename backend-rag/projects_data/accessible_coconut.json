    {
      "What is Coco-Patcher ?": "It’s a small software through which one can run scripts provided by Accessible-Coconut development team. Many fixes can be provided through this channel so that users don’t have to jump to new release of Coconut. Also optional software or drivers can be installed using the same."
    },
    {
      "Why Coconut uses Mate as default desktop environment?": "Mate has the following qualities, in comparison with Gnome-3, Unity, or Gnome-Flashback: 1) Lightweight – it will consume less power, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc., and will run in any low configuration systems. 2) Responds very quickly and it is one of the speedy desktop environments like XFCE. 3) Easy to use – provides both application menu and menu that support search (Try pressing Super key (Window key), type application name, and launch). 4) Mate only tries to keep traditional desktop experience and it uses the latest software libraries like GTK-3 graphical user interface toolkit. 5) It is under active development. Finally, it is very accessible with screen reader in an inclusive way. It is not a desktop environment for visually impaired alone. It is a desktop environment developed by a huge community who are not fascinated by the looks and feel of Gnome-3 and also frustrated by the lack of simplicity of Gnome-3."

      "Where can I get a detailed Orca documentation?": "https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/"
    },
    {
      "How do I check the ip address of the connected network": "Hold Super(Windows) key and press Tab key again and again to focus ‘Top panel’, press left arrow to navigate to Network, press down arrow and open ‘Connection information’."
    },
    {
      "How can I mount Google Drive in Coconut ?": "Step 1: install gnome-online-accounts by running the following command in terminal. sudo apt install gnome-control-center gnome-online-accounts. Step 2: Adding google account. Open gnome-control-center by running the command ‘gnome-control-center’. Now go to ‘Online Accounts’, select ‘Google’ and add your Google account. While adding, you may feel some accessibility issues; you can press Tab and Shift+Tab to check where you are. But it’s only for a few steps: email address, password, and an agree button. Step 3: Exploring your Google drive. Go to Applications -> Places and select the entry named your_email_address@gmail.com"
